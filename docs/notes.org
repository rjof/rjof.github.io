* Notes

The package *tidycovid19* was only installable from inside R
~remotes::install_github("joachim-gassen/tidycovid19")~

** To try

Does /pip/ succees in your local environment?

~pip install git+git://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra@master~

As /pip/ failed to install and it could be because of my local
environment it is worth to try to put it in the environment.yml as
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dependencies:
   - pip:
     - git+git://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
